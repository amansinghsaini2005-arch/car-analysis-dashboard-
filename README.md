 I’m excited to share my latest project analyzing 4 years of sales transaction data (2019–2022) to uncover actionable insights. By breaking down key metrics like Sales, Quantity, and Profit across categories such as Furniture and Technology, this report highlights critical areas for operational efficiency.
To ensure these insights were accessible, I applied modern dashboard design principles focusing on clarity and user experience:
• Decluttered Visuals: I streamlined charts by removing unnecessary titles and legends to let the data tell the story.
• Interactive Navigation: The design features a custom drop-down menu and slicer panel, allowing users to easily filter by Region or Ship Mode.
• Dynamic Search: A dedicated search bar was implemented to quickly locate specific customer segments and values.
Check out the attached presentation for a detailed look at the regional performance and profit margins!
